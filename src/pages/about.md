## Education üßë‚Äçüè´

I am finishing up a MLIS at Florida State University. I think libraries are awesome, and that the historical instituion of a library is a great model for an open internet. *PhD announcement soon?* üëÄ

I studied psychology and computer science at Georgia Tech. Whisk the two until you get stiff peaks, call that human-computer interaction. Sang in the Glee Club, made games with [VGDev](https://vgdev.gtorg.gatech.edu/), changed majors 30 times, worked on computer science education research with the [Expressive Machinery Lab.](https://expressivemachinery.gatech.edu/) 

## Work ‚òï

I have worked for Ionic, where I was a core contributor to the [Ionic Framework](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework). 

I have worked for groups at Florida State University and Old Dominion University, making and designing digital things like OER and research tools.

I have worked for Cartoon Network and Adult Swim, making sure their games were bug free... [well I tried.](https://www.polygon.com/2017/10/31/16581842/steven-universe-save-the-light-review) 

## Random ü§†

I am a socialist. I am anti-capitalist, anti-racist, anti-fascist. Workers starve while Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos send rich people to the moon.

Places I have lived: Norfolk VA, Atlanta GA, Hoschton GA (hometown). 

I was recently diagnosed as ADHD--so still working on that. Take care of your mental health!

Thanks for visiting my little site. It was built with a cool tool, [Eleventy.](https://www.11ty.dev/) (There are a billion ways to make a website, with or without coding. Try it!)
