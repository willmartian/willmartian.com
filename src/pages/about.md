## Work ‚òï

I am currently a front end engineer at [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com), the open source password manager.

I worked for Ionic, where I was a core contributor to the [Ionic Framework](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework). 

I worked for Florida State University and Old Dominion University, developing and designing digital things like OER and research tools.

I worked for Cartoon Network and Adult Swim, making sure their games were bug free... [well I tried.](https://www.polygon.com/2017/10/31/16581842/steven-universe-save-the-light-review) 

## Education üßë‚Äçüè´

I recently finished a MLIS at Florida State University. I think libraries are awesome, and that they are the perfect model for an open internet.

I studied psychology and computer science at Georgia Tech. Whisk the two until you get stiff peaks, call that human-computer interaction. Sang in the Glee Club, made games with [VGDev](https://vgdev.gtorg.gatech.edu/), changed majors 30 times, worked on computer science education research with the [Expressive Machinery Lab.](https://expressivemachinery.gatech.edu/) (I have so many thoughts and feelings about GT, feel free to reach out if you are a prospective student!)

## Random ü§†

Places I have lived: Spent my childhood around Hoschton and Flowery Branch, GA. Went to college in Atlanta, my *small town to big city moment*. Moved to Norfolk VA for a couple of years with my partner--an absolutely lovely city that I will miss. But I am soon moving back to ATL and couldn't be happier returning to my *chosen* hometown. 

I was recently diagnosed with ADHD--things are going much better after my diagnosis! Take care of your mental health.

Thanks for visiting my little site. It was built with a cool tool, [Eleventy.](https://www.11ty.dev/) (There are a billion ways to make a website, with or without coding. Try it!)
