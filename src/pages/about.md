  title: about me
---

Hi. I am currently a senior front end engineer at [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com), the open source password manager. I work on the "platform" team--I build tools and libraries that (hopefully) makes everyone else's work easier.

Before that, I worked on the [Ionic Framework](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework), an open source UI toolkit. I've also worked for Old Dominion University and Cartoon Network.

I studied HCI at Georgia Tech and did my MLIS at Florida State.
