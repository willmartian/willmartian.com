I made a sarcastic programming project. 

Some people thought is was funny; as of writing this:
- It has been starred about 400 times on [GitHub](https://github.com/willmartindev/div.js).
- It was featured in a [web dev newsletter](https://bytes.dev/).
- Reddit gave it a [big thumbs up](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/o2qtnq/introducing_divjs_a_framework_for_the_html/).

So all in all, I feel fairly validated. I am really only writing this blog post so more people think I am funny. But seriously, why do we need *so many* HTML elements?

## A little context

HTML is complex markup language, with [around 140 tags]() used to describe and structure content. Big emphasis on *describe*, as HTML is meant to give semantic meaning to content.
