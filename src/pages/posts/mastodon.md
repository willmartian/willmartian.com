Imagine if the only email provider anyone used was Gmail, and that you could only email people with Gmail addresses. If Gmail were to one day drastically change, go out of business, or disappear… Well, if all you had to choose from was Gmail, you would be out of luck.

Thankfully, email doesn’t actually work like this. One can create an email account with Hotmail and send and receive mail to others on Gmail, Protonmail, etc. One can even set up your own email server and host it yourself, if you are into that.

[Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org) is a social network that works like email. Instead of everyone using one social network provider and being locked in, they can create a Mastodon account wherever they want to without losing the ability to connect with their friends on other sites. 

You can browse some different Mastodon sites (also known as *instances*) [here.](https://joinmastodon.org/servers) There are general purpose sites (such as [mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social) and [mas.to](https://mas.to)) and sites that cater to specific topics or geographic areas. Personally, I am currently on [fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org), an instance focused on computers and software. 

Found this helpful? I will be writing a blog post on Mastodon and social media for each week of November. Create an account on any Mastodon site you like and follow me at [@willmartian@fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org/@willmartian) for updates. (See, the usernames even *look* like email addresses!)
